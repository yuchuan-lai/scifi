Description: Obtain the ARIMA based statistical forecasting or the GARIMA projections of temperature and 
    precipitation at individual city for engineering applications. Forecasting techniques include the 
    annual temperature an precipitation forecasting, estimating confidence levels for annual extremes with return 
    periods, and simulating future daily temperature and precipitation.
    Additional functions for downloading available historical observations from more than 100 US cities, 
    annual forecasting of other statistical techniques, and plotting the obtained forecasts are provided.
