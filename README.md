# Statistical Climate Forecasting Integrated for Civil and Environmental Engineering (scifi) R Package

This package provides an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) based statistical near-term (2 to 20 years) regional temperature and precipitation forecasting model.

Please refer to the following article for the descriptions of the forecasting techniques: https://doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-19-0158.1

The following article describes the techniques of the GCM-ARIMA (G-ARIMA) model, which provides an integrative forecasting technique combining the GCM projections and ARIMA forecasting: https://doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0204.1
